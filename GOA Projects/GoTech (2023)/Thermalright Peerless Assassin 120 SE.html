            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">Thermalright's Peerless Assassin 120 SE</span> is a value-oriented CPU cooler that costs just around $40 and offers six heat pipes and two 120mm fans.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Although brands like Arctic, Noctua, and Corsair are well-known and command respect in the premium segment of the CPU cooler market, it's a different story in the budget segment. Thermalright's cheap CPU coolers have put old champions to shame thanks to their unbelievably low prices and great performance. For $40, it's hard to ignore the Peerless Assassin 120 SE, a cooler that competes with rivals twice its price.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">With six heat pipes, lots of mass, and two 120mm fans, the Peerless Assassin is pretty overkill for the 13400F but is so cheap that you might as well get it anyways. Its extra cooling prowess will come in handy if you ever upgrade to the 13600K or 13700K (the Peerless Assassin might not be able to handle the 13900K). Legendary coolers like Noctua's NH-D15 perform worse than the Peerless Assassin in reviews, and high-end 240mm AIO coolers are only marginally better.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">When it comes to value, Thermalright's Peerless Assassin can't be beaten, at least not right now. It's not a particularly great-looking cooler and does require low-profile memory, but if you can overlook those two minor downsides, you can enjoy great cooling performance that allows for either a very quiet or a very fast PC.</p>
