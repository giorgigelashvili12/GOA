            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">Solidigm P41 Plus</span> is a budget PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD that targets great value with respect to performance and capacity.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Considering the other components in this build guide, getting an SSD with more capacity than performance is a priority, and thankfully SSDs (particularly lower-end ones) have never been cheaper. One of the latest budget PCIe 4.0 drives is Solidigm's P41 Plus, which is priced aggressively at $100 for the 2TB model and should be able to store plenty of games and other data.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The P41 Plus is rated for a pretty slow maximum transfer speed at 4,125MB/s and 3,325MB/s in reads and writes, respectively. However, that's only for purely sequential workloads which are uncommon, and in our review, the P41 Plus performed decently enough. Solidigm also makes custom drivers and software for the P41 Plus to help it perform as fast as possible, something that very few other vendors bother doing these days. Especially for gaming, trading off performance for capacity is worthwhile.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Solidigm's P41 Plus isn't a speed champion, but it's one of the cheapest 2TB SSDs you can buy while also being fairly modern. Even if you ever feel the need to upgrade to a faster SSD, you can still keep the P41 Plus as a secondary drive where you store the bulk of your data, though migrating your OS to a faster SSD will be somewhat annoying.</p>
