# Binary Search Algorithm ( basically O(log n) )
Binary Search is more efficient search algorithm, but can be only used with sorted data. It works by repeatedly diving the search space in half which allows to target the value in fewer steps. Half of the array is eliminated during each step. Let's take an array of sorted letetrs, and look for the letter G and its index. First we begin in the middle, so we check if the target value is equal to the middle value, if equal then we will return the index, but its highly likely that the targeted element will not be in the middle on the very first try. Then we check if the target is less or greater, in this example, since G is greater then the letter before it, we will "eliminate" the first half, and continue with the process. After that, we begin in the middle and the same process so on. Since G is less then the half (I, J, K), those will be eliminated too. If there's 2 letters left, with rounding we will disregard and continue with the same process until we will get the result. It is effecient with large data such as 1 million elements meaning this algorithm is indeed fantastic. This is so because we can disregard half a million elements.
