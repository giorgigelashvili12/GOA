            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">MSI's Pro Z690-P </span>is a midrange LGA 1700 motherboard with a 14-phase VRM with support for DDR4 RAM, PCIe 5.0 GPUs, and two PCIe 4.0 SSDs.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">If you're building a PC that you plan on upgrading down the line, the motherboard is a very important component to invest in since it can determine maximum CPU power draw (and by extension, performance), what kind of memory you'll be using, what version of PCIe you'll have, and so on. Thankfully, last-generation Z690 motherboards can be found for less than $200 today, and one of my favorites is MSI's Pro Z690-P, which can be found for as little as $150.</p>
