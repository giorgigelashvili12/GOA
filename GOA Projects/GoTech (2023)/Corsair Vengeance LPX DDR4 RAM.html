            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 RAM</span>memory is affordable, reliable, has one of the lowest profile designs around and with XMP has a one click setup.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Corsair's Vengeance LPX DDR4 RAM is extremely popular, and for good reason: it's really cheap and has good performance. I recommend the 16GB kit, which costs about $40 and provides similar specifications to other RAM kits that cost significantly more. For almost every user, LPX memory is the kit to buy.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The only negative thing I have to say about LPX memory is how the heatspreader looks. It's not a very attractive design compared to other models out there. However, this RAM is low-profile which is important since the Thermalright Peerless Assassin requires low-profile RAM in order to fit on the motherboard. You're saving money not just on the RAM itself, but also the CPU cooler by opting for LPX RAM.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">As for performance, the LPX kit we're specifically recommending has a frequency of 3200MHz and is rated at CL16. That's not the fastest speeds and latency DDR4 can achieve, but faster kits are both extremely expensive and also don't usually result in big performance gains in either games or other applications, especially if you're going with the 13400(F). Pairing this kind of memory even with the Core i9-13900K wouldn't be much of a problem unless you're trying to achieve super high framerates rather than enabling high quality graphics settings.</p>
