    <p style="padding: 30px; font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">AMD used to rule the budget CPU landscape,</span> but these days it's actually Intel that provides the best bang for buck. The Core i5-13400F is Intel's new mainstream champion and comes with lots more cores than the Core i5-12400(F), the budget champion of the last generation. We'd still recommend the 12400(F) since it's much cheaper but between the 13400F's higher performance and the fact that 12th-generation CPUs got a price bump, the 13400F seems like the better option.

        <br><br>One thing the 13400 is conspicuously missing is that -K suffix that denotes overclocking support. While overclocking has never been particularly mainstream, it's even farther removed from the mainstream as CPUs come with higher and higher clock speeds out of the box, making overclocking not as appealing as it used to be. The 13400 comes with a boost clock speed of 4.6GHz, and you can be pretty confident it'll run at or close to its boost frequency thanks to its 154 watt max TDP. Additionally, this is an -F class CPU which means it has no integrated graphics but comes at a discount compared to the regular 13400 (which is otherwise identical).</p>
