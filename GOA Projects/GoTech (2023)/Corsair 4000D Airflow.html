            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">Corsair 4000D Airflow</span> is one of the best airflow cases you can buy to have a full front-to-back airflow for your components. It comes pre-installed with two RGB 120mm fans.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">A quick look at our collection of the best PC cases will give you plenty of PC case options for your build, and if you've been following this guide to the letter it doesn't matter too much what case you select as long as it has support for ATX motherboards like MSI's Pro Z690-P. There are lots of great ATX cases to choose from including Corsair's 4000D Airflow, a mid-tower for midrange PCs that can support some high-end upgrades down the line.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The 4000D is particularly strong when it comes to component compatibility and clearance. It supports CPU air coolers up to 170mm in height, GPUs up to 360mm in length, up to a 360mm radiator at the top, and up to a 280mm radiator at the front. This is going to give you plenty of wiggle room for both air and liquid CPU coolers as well as longer and larger GPUs once you're ready to move on from the 6650 XT. You could even put some top-end components in this chassis without any issues.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">There are one or two potential problems with the 4000D, however. Firstly, it's pretty plain and dark, and while many of us in the PC community hate RGB, it's also true that not everyone is into pure black. Secondly, the 4000D only comes with two case fans, which is a problem if you want to achieve good temperatures on your CPU and GPU. You might want to pick up some extra 120mm fans or consider getting a 360mm AIO liquid cooler, which can basically act as your intake fans at the front while also providing great cooling for the CPU.</p>
