            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G5</span> is a 650W power supply with an 80 Plus Gold rating and uses modular power cables.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Based on the parts that we've picked for this particular build, a 650W power supply unit should be enough to power all the components. As such, I've picked EVGA's SuperNOVA 650 G5 with an 80 Plus Gold rating. Technically you could use a lower-end PSU with lower wattage, but it's nice to have some extra power just in case you want to upgrade. Additionally, this power supply also uses modular cables, which is a luxury I recommend investing in with a $1,000 budget.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">To give you an idea of why I recommend a PSU with more power than you technically need, let's look at the parts I've recommended for this build. The 13400 has a max TDP of 153W and the 6650 XT is rated for 180W, which means these parts alone can consume about 330W. We can estimate everything else in the PC will probably consume 50â€“100 additional watts, which leaves this PC at about 400 watts of power consumption under full load. If you wanted to upgrade to Core i9-13900K or RX 7900 XTX down the road, you're looking at an extra 200 watts, and a 650W PSU gives you plenty of wiggle room.</p><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">You can also spend less by choosing PSUs with lower efficiency ratings or from cheaper brands, but you really do not wanna cheap out on the PSU for a $1,000 PC. If your budget is several hundred dollars large, saving $50 on the PSU is kind of pointless. It's just a terrible idea because if your PSU fails, the best-case scenario is that you need to replace it, and in the worst case you might have to replace multiple components. EVGA, Seasonic, and Corsair are some of the most trusted brands for power supplies and I highly recommend you pick up a model like EVGA's SuperNOVA 650 G5.</p>
