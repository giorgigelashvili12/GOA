    <h2>Experts In Advesary Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
        Underpinning all of HYAS solutions is an adversary 
        infrastructure platform with a large, dynamic data 
        lake that constantly ingests data from a variety of 
        authoritative sources across exclusive, private, 
        and commercial sources. The platform powers all of the 
        HYAS solutions, which are designed to be easy to deploy
        and manage, deliver value by themselves as well as 
        seamlessly integrating into any existing security stack
        and client architecture.
        <br>
        As good as security defenses are, there will always be
        something that gets through. But most organizations
        do not know they have been breached until it’s too
        late. Even if an attack has bypassed a network’s
        perimeter defenses - and regardless of how the breach
        occurred -  it still must “beacon out” for
        instructions to its cybercriminal command-and-control
        (C2), or adversary infrastructure, in order to initiate.
        The HYAS Adversary Infrastructure Platform detects and
        blocks the beaconing requests of malicious and anomalous
        command-and-control communication and stops attackers
        from progressing.
        <br>
        By identifying and blocking communication to the adversary’s
        command-and-control, HYAS is able to alert organizations
        that something has infiltrated the environment, has gotten
        past all the security barriers, and is now beaconing out for
        instructions. The attack can be rendered inert, enabling
        true business and operational resiliency against attacks
        of all forms, including but not limited to supply-chain,
        insider risk, phishing, and ransomware.
        <br>
        HYAS solutions provide organizations of all sizes the
        visibility and observability they need to stay in control
        of their environment. Threat and fraud analysts can 
        investigate any attack or IOC, rapidly discover 
        related indicators and map out the complete 
        cybercriminal campaign architecture, identify where 
        it came from, and take a proactive stance against future 
        attacks by understanding what remaining infrastructure 
        hasn’t yet been weaponized or utilized.
