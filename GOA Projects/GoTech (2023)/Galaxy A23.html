            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline blue;">Galaxy A23</span> As usual, Samsung kicked off 2023 with the latest entries in its mainline flagship series. The Samsung Galaxy S23, S23+, and S23 Ultra aren't the most exciting phones we've ever seen, but if you've been holding off on upgrading that aging Galaxy Note 9, these devices are as good a trio as the company has ever released. Last year's Galaxy S22 series blew us away, after all, and this year, Samsung has brought the best of its design to all three models.</p><br><br>
